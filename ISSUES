> Issue: a68g 2.6, Bus Error on SPARC
> Filed: 2012-11-30 by Hannu-Heikki Puupponen
> Status: unable to reproduce on non-SPARC machines, no access to SPARCs.
>
> Target machine is Sun SPARCStation 10 with two SM81 SuperSPARC II CPU 
> modules, 512M memory. OS is NetBSD 4.0.
>
> Some regression tests cause a Bus Error, typically caused by unaligned fetch, 
> SPARC being one of the architectures that do not support unaligned fetches at all.
