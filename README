ALGOL68G - ALGOL 68 GENIE

Algol68G is an implementation of Algol 68 as defined by the Revised Report.
It ranks among the most complete implementations of the language.

THE ALGOL 68 GENIE PROJECT

The development of Algol played an important role in establishing computer 
science as an academic discipline. The Algol 68 Genie project preserves and 
promotes Algol 68 out of educational as well as scientific-historical interest,
by making available a recent checkout compiler-interpreter written from scratch
by Marcel van der Veer.

Algol 68 Genie is a fast compiler-interpreter which ranks among the most
complete implementations of the language; it supports for instance 

* partial parametrisation,
* parallel processing,  
* formatted transput and a
* refinement preprocessor.

A detailed description of Algol 68 is in the book 

        Learning Algol 68 Genie

which contains an informal introduction to the language, a manual for 
Algol 68 Genie, and the Revised Report on Algol 68.

Algol 68 is a secure, expression-oriented programming language with which you 
elegantly code algorithms without having to bother too much about irrelevant 
technical details and limitations inherent to many other languages.

Algol 68 Genie offers for example:

* many runtime checks facilitating debugging and improving the 
  reliability of your programs,
* native support for arbitrary precision arithmetic including 
  complex numbers, 
* syntactic constructions to support linear algebra,
* a gdb-style debugger and a pretty-printer to 
  beautify source code,
* optional linkage to GNU plotutils, the GNU scientific library or 
  PostgreSQL, 
* extensions as UNIX pipes, regular expression matching, and 
  web page content fetching.
